# WHAT IS?
A small Chat Application that uses Remote Method Invocation (RMI), allows users to connect to the same server and chat

## WHAT WORKS?
* Connection between client and server
* Possibilty to have multiple clients
* Server adds clients to list
* Server sends messages to all clients
* Server removes Client from list when the Client closes the Chat Windows
* Graphical User Interface
* The messages are showed in the chatBox TextArea

## WHAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED?
* The inputs for the Client can be done in another window inside ClientGUI instead of doing it on the Client constructor.

## WHAT CAN YOU DO?
* You are free to use this as you want but, if you manage to improve this, share!
